# AI Agent Testing & Improvements

## Summary of Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed Context Initialization**
- Added `conversationStage` field initialization (was missing, causing type errors)
- Added `previousQuestions` field initialization (was missing, causing type errors)
- Constructor now accepts optional `initialContext` parameter for flexibility
- All required fields are properly initialized with default values

### 2. **Enhanced Conversation Flow**
- Added `updateConversationStage()` method to dynamically track conversation progress
- Improved stage transitions: initial → exploration → deepening → specifics → completion
- Better logic for determining when to continue conversation vs. generate manifestation plan
- More realistic thresholds (5 exchanges minimum, 3 themes minimum, 10 total exchanges)

### 3. **Improved Question Tracking**
- Questions are now tracked in `previousQuestions` array
- System prompt includes list of previous questions to avoid repetition
- Each generated question is automatically added to tracking
- Fallback questions also tracked to maintain consistency

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Input validation for empty user responses
- Try-catch blocks with meaningful error logging
- Fallback questions that maintain conversation flow
- Graceful degradation when API calls fail
- Fixed all linting warnings

### 5. **More Robust AI Prompts**
- Comprehensive system prompt with conversation stage guidance
- Example questions for each stage to guide AI behavior
- Context includes: response count, theme count, emotional state, stage
- Explicit instructions to avoid repetitive questions
- Temperature set to 0.8 for creative yet coherent responses

### 6. **Enhanced Theme Extraction**
- More specific theme categories (e.g., "romantic relationships" vs. "relationships")
- Duplicate theme prevention
- Better error handling for JSON parsing
- Increased token limit (150) for more detailed themes

### 7. **New Features**
- Added `getInitialQuestion()` method for starting conversations
- Proper fallback mechanisms throughout
- Context can be pre-loaded via constructor
- Better integration with existing API route

## Testing the AI Agent

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Test the conversation flow:**
   - Start a new conversation
   - Answer each question naturally
   - Observe:
     - Questions become progressively deeper
     - No repetitive questions
     - Appropriate stage transitions
     - Images appear after 1st response
     - Conversation completes after sufficient exchanges

### Expected Behavior:

**Stage 1 - Initial (0 exchanges):**
- Opening question about ideal life vision
- Broad and inviting

**Stage 2 - Exploration (1-2 exchanges):**
- Questions about different life areas
- Identifying manifestation themes
- Images start showing

**Stage 3 - Deepening (3-5 exchanges):**
- Questions about feelings and emotions
- Deeper exploration of specific manifestations
- More targeted image selection

**Stage 4 - Specifics (6-7 exchanges):**
- Questions about details and obstacles
- Action-oriented inquiries
- Preparing for plan generation

**Stage 5 - Completion (8+ exchanges):**
- Final clarifying questions
- Transition to manifestation plan
- Summary of conversation

### API Integration:

The AI agent works seamlessly with the existing API route at `/api/ai-agent`:

```typescript
// API call from frontend
const response = await fetch('/api/ai-agent', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userResponse,
    context: conversationContext,
    manifestationId,
    project
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
// Returns: { question, context, shouldShowImages, isComplete, nextAction, relevantImages }
```

## Key Improvements in Code Quality:

1. ✅ All TypeScript types properly satisfied
2. ✅ No linting errors or warnings
3. ✅ Proper error handling throughout
4. ✅ Clear code comments
5. ✅ Consistent naming conventions
6. ✅ Modular and maintainable structure
7. ✅ Backward compatible with existing code

## Configuration Notes:

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Must be set in `.env.local`

**API Models Used:**
- GPT-4 for question generation (more creative and coherent)
- GPT-3.5-turbo for emotion/theme analysis (faster and cheaper)

**Token Limits:**
- Question generation: 200 tokens
- Emotion analysis: 10 tokens
- Theme extraction: 150 tokens
- Manifestation plan: 800 tokens

## Troubleshooting:

**If questions aren't generating:**
1. Check OpenAI API key in `.env.local`
2. Verify API key has sufficient credits
3. Check console for error messages
4. Ensure proper CORS settings

**If conversation doesn't progress:**
1. Check `shouldContinueConversation()` logic
2. Verify context is being updated
3. Look for stage transition issues
4. Check conversation history length

**If images don't show:**
1. Verify `shouldShowImages()` returns true after 1st exchange
2. Check relevantImages array in API response
3. Ensure image files exist in `/public/inspiration-images/`
4. Verify InspirationCarousel component is rendering

## Performance Considerations:

- Emotion analysis: ~0.5-1 second
- Theme extraction: ~1-2 seconds  
- Question generation: ~2-4 seconds
- Total response time: ~3-7 seconds per exchange

This is acceptable for an interactive conversation experience.
