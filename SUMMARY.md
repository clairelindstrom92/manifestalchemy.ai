# Manifest Alchemy AI - Troubleshooting Summary

## Problem
The chat functionality on manifestalchemy.ai is showing errors and not working.

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: HuggingFace API Integration
- **Problem**: HuggingFace models were not available or had permission issues
- **Error**: "No Inference Provider available for model"
- **Attempted Fix**: Tried multiple models (DialoGPT, BlenderBot, GPT-2, BLOOM)
- **Result**: Failed - Permission issues with Inference Providers

### Issue 2: Vercel AI Gateway
- **Problem**: Vercel AI Gateway deployment not found
- **Error**: "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND"
- **Attempted Fix**: Used Vercel AI Gateway API key
- **Result**: Failed - Deployment not found error

### Issue 3: Current State - OpenAI Integration
- **Current Setup**: Using OpenAI with AI SDK
- **Issue**: Build failing - likely missing OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- **Status**: Needs OpenAI API key to be added to Vercel

## Recommended Solution

### Step 1: Add OpenAI API Key
1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key
4. Redeploy the application

### Alternative: Use a Free/Open Source Model
If you don't want to use OpenAI (which costs money), we can switch to:
- Groq (free, fast inference)
- HuggingFace models with proper setup
- Local models

## What We've Tried
1. ✅ HuggingFace Integration (failed due to permissions)
2. ✅ Vercel AI Gateway (failed - deployment not found)
3. ✅ OpenAI with AI SDK (needs API key)

## Next Steps
1. Add OPENAI_API_KEY to Vercel environment variables
2. Or switch to a different free AI provider
3. Redeploy and test
